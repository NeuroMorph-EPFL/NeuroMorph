# NeuroMorph Analysis and Visualization Toolkit

NeuroMorph is a toolset designed to import, analyze, and visualize mesh models in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). It has been developed specifically for the morphological analysis of 3D objects derived from serial electron microscopy images of brain tissue, but much of its functionality can be applied to any 3D mesh.  These mesh objects can be generated by any 3D image segmentation software, such as [ilastik](http://ilastik.org/) or [Fiji](http://fiji.sc/Fiji).
<br>

All the NeuroMorph tools for **Blender 2.8** can be found in the NeuroMorph_Blender_2.8 folder, as beta releases.  Once we have finished testing these tools, a new version of NeuroMorph will be released.

# Documentation

[NeuroMorph Wiki](https://github.com/NeuroMorph-EPFL/NeuroMorph/wiki)  
Detailed instructions for each tool.

[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkcYjWgceM&vq=hd720)  
Not up-to-date, but still helpful for the measurement and image stack interaction tools.  

*Installation Note: NeuroMorph tools are found in the "NeuroMorph" tab on the far left in Blender.*
